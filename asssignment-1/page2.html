    <p style="font-size:460%;">One stormy day Jesus and Satan are arguing about who is the better writer.

        Obviously at some point God has enough and gives them a competition. “Whoever can write the best essay in two
        hours
        <a href="page3.html">wins</a>.”
    </p>

            background-attachment: fixed;
            background-size: cover;
