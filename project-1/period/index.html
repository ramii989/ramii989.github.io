        <h2>Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop
            sometime</h2>
        <p id="loremtext">and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and
            again stop
            some time then periods had to exist. Beside I had always like the look of periods and I liked what they did.
            Stopping
            sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that
            happened, and
            as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really
            never stopped
            using them. Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things
            in arbitrary
            ways, that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read
            you a little
            of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years ago periods had come to have for me completely
            a life of
            their own. They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that
            is not
            really interrupt one’s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s
            writing and so
            they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they could come in
            this way to
            have a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons do.
            Yes you do
            feel what I mean. Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of
            their own.
            And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is the
            reason that I
            have always remained true to periods so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them
            more than
            one had ever needed them. You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon or
            a
            semi-colon.</p>
