        <h2>How Firewheel Got its Color</h2>
        <p>
            Firewheel has a rich history in Native American lore. In the book “Legends and Lore of Texas Wildflowers” by
            Elizabeth
            Silverthorne, an old Mexican legend tells how the firewheel got its unique color. According to the story,
            firewheel was
            once an all yellow wildflower in the days of the Aztecs. Women would adorn themselves with the bright yellow
            flowers,
            and children would play among them in the meadows. Then Cortez came, spreading death and destruction
            throughout the
            land. The bright yellow flower felt pity for the deaths of the inhabitants and caught their blood as it
            fell. To this
            day the firewheel remains red with the blood of the Aztecs.</p>
        <h2>Indian Blanket Flower</h2>
        Firewheel is also known as Indian blanket flower, a name that comes from another legend. In the same book, the
        story
        goes that braves from a certain tribe went to war, leaving behind their wives and children. Soon after, the wife
        of the
        chief began weaving a blanket for her husband. In the blanket she wove threads of red and orange, each pattern a
        symbol
        of her prayer to the Great Spirit to keep her husband safe. One day the daughter of the chief was out playing in
        the
        woods and got lost. Night soon fell, and the little girl prayed to the Great Spirit to send the blanket to keep
        her warm
        during the night. She fell asleep. The next morning she found herself covered in flowers of the same red and
        orange
        colors as the blanket. Her father, returning from war, found his daughter covered in the beautiful flowers. From
        that
        time on, the flowers were called Indian blanket flower.
